    Containerization is the process of packaging an application along with its required libraries, frameworks, and configuration files together so that it can be run in various computing environments efficiently. In simpler terms, containerization is the encapsulation of an application and its required environment.<br>

It has lately been gaining lots of traction as it overcomes the challenges that stem from running virtual machines. A virtual machine emulates an entire operating system inside the host operating system and requires a fixed percentage of hardware allocation that goes into running all the processes of an operating system. And this, therefore, leads to unnecessary wastage of computing resources due to large overhead.<br>

Also, setting up a virtual machine takes time, and so does the process of setting up a particular application in each and every virtual machine. This results in a significant amount of time and effort being taken up in just setting up the environment. Containerization, popularized by the open-source project ‘Docker’, circumvents these problems and provides increased portability by packaging all the required dependencies in a portable image file along with the software.<br>

Let us dive deeper into containerization, its benefits, how it works, ways of choosing the tool for containerization and how it trumps the usage of virtual machines (VMs).<br>

Some popular container providers are Linux Containers like LXC and LCD, Docker, and Windows Server Containers.<br><br>

    <h1>What is Docker?</h1>

    Docker has become a popular term in the IT industry, and rightly so. Docker can be defined as an open-source software platform which offers a simplified way of building, testing, securing, and deploying applications within containers. Docker encourages software developers to collaborate with cloud, Linux, and Windows operating systems for easy and faster delivery of services.<br>

Docker is a platform that provides containerization. It allows for packaging of an application and its dependencies into a container, thereby, helping ease the development and accelerate the deployment of the software. It helps maximize output by doing away with the need to replicate the local environment on each machine on which the solution is supposed to be tested, thus saving valuable time and effort that would go into the furthering of the progress.<br>

Docker file can be quickly transferred and tested among the workers. The process of container image management is also made simple by Docker and is quickly revolutionizing the way we develop and test applications at scale.<br>
